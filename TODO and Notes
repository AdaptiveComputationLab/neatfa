-- power law, rediculous distribution

(32x32)   1 of these piles, 1  x 1  = 1
(16x16)   4 of these piles, 2  x 2  = 4
 (8x8)   16 of these piles, 4  x 4  = 16
 (4x4)   64 of these piles, 8  x 8  = 64
 (2x2)  256 of these piles, 16 x 16 = 256
 (1x1) 1024 of these piles, 32 x 32 = 1024

in order to increase, multiply by 2, for example see above
1  piles of 64 (8x8)
4  piles of 16 (4x4)
16 piles of 4  (2x2)
64 piles of 1  (1x1)

finish in 4 weeks (from 1.9.15)

data to collect
-----> number of tags collected in x ticks (converted to 1 hour)
-----> re-introduce messy positioning for pheromones/fidelity

todo, demo, Jan 30, 12-2pm

. optimize time based parameters
. fix clustering algorithms
. testing
    a. using argos to replicate past experiments
. streamline definition of time vs frames, etc.
. improve distribution functions
    1x64, max number of other piles
. streamline classes (variables, functions, implementation)
. speed up painting

<!-- for power law: (only one pile this size) [64] (8x8 cluster), 
                    (as many as possible)     [16] (4x4 cluster), 
                    (as many as possible)      [4] (2x2 cluster), 
                                               [1] (random place rest) -->

1. implement site fidelity markers
2. Test 1: power law distribution
   |--force on Site fidelity (siteFidelityRate = 0)
   |--force on pheromone (siteFidelityRate = 20), (pheromoneRate = 0), (pheromoneDecayRate = 0.5)
   |--1 robot
3. Test 2: power law distribution
   |--force on pheromone, sitefidelity = 20, pheromoneRate = 0, pheromoneDecay = 0
   |--6 robots


sitefidelity: 0 on, 20 off, from 0 to 20
pheromoneRate:  0 always lay pheromone, 20 never lay pheromone
pheromoneDecayRate: 0 = slow decay, 1 = fast decay

        ================
        | UNIT TESTING |
        ================

        [1] correct pheromone placement test: disable pheromone decay (pheromoneDecayRate = 0)

        [2] correct pheromone laying: [1] + enable pheromone laying (pheromoneRate = 0)

        [3] correct pheromone following: enable pheromone following (siteFidelityRate++)

        [4] correct site fidelity: (siteFidelityRate = 20)

        NOTES: pheromoneRate and siteFidelityRate have values from 0 (on) to 20 (off)
