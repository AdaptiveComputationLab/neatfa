notes about clustering
----------------------
    current clustering optimization is using B.I.C.: bayesian information criterion
    TODO, read about BIC and learn how it works (hint: statistics)

ideas:
    -- in the future, think about adding/implementing clustering
    -- in the future, think about adding/implementing genetic algorithm

data to collect
-----> re-introduce messy/clean positioning for pheromones/fidelity
       as a toggable feature

. optimize time based parameters
. fix clustering food distribution algorithms
    -----> they all work, however, they may still generate bugs based on invalid XML input
. testing
    a. using argos to replicate past experiments
    b. make graphs and data collection examples
. streamline definition of time vs frames, etc.
. streamline classes (variables, functions, implementation)

sitefidelity: 0 on, 20 off, from 0 to 20
pheromoneRate:  0 always lay pheromone, 20 never lay pheromone
pheromoneDecayRate: 0 = slow decay, 1 = fast decay

        ================
        | UNIT TESTING |
        ================

        [1] correct pheromone placement test: disable pheromone decay (pheromoneDecayRate = 0)
        [2] correct pheromone laying: [1] + enable pheromone laying (pheromoneRate = 0)
        [3] correct pheromone following: enable pheromone following (siteFidelityRate++)
        [4] correct site fidelity: (siteFidelityRate = 20)

        NOTES: pheromoneRate and siteFidelityRate have values from 0 (on) to 20 (off)
