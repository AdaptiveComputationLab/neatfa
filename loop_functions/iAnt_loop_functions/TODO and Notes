1. implement site fidelity markers
2. Test 1: power law distribution
   |--force on Site fidelity (siteFidelityRate = 0)
   |--force on pheromone (siteFidelityRate = 20), (pheromoneRate = 0), (pheromoneDecayRate = 0.5)
   |--1 robot
3. Test 2: power law distribution
   |--force on pheromone, sitefidelity = 20, pheromoneRate = 0, pheromoneDecay = 0
   |--6 robots


sitefidelity: 0 on, 20 off, from 0 to 20
pheromoneRate:  0 always lay pheromone, 20 never lay pheromone
pheromoneDecayRate: 0 = slow decay, 1 = fast decay


        ================
        | UNIT TESTING |
        ================

        [1] correct pheromone placement test: disable pheromone decay (pheromoneDecayRate = 0)

        [2] correct pheromone laying: [1] + enable pheromone laying (pheromoneRate = 0)

        [3] correct pheromone following: enable pheromone following (siteFidelityRate++)

        [4] correct site fidelity: (siteFidelityRate = 20)

        NOTES: pheromoneRate and siteFidelityRate have values from 0 (on) to 20 (off)
