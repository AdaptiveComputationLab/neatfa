== NeatFA

NeatFA is an application of Neuro Evolution of Augmented Topologies to the foraging problem in swarm robotics.
This project includes a forked version of (http://www.argos-sim.info/)[ARGoS] that evalutes an input neural network and returns the fitness.
Also this project includes a controlling application that evolves the neural network using (http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?jneat)[JNeat] and evalutes the population with multiple ARGoS simulations in parallel. 

=== Directions

This project has two parts.
First is the application to evolve a neural network via NEAT to forage in ARGoS.
Second, this project offers a handful of tools to evaluate the analyze the generated networks.

==== Build ARGoS

To start, you need to build ARGoS.
This may require the installation of a handful of dependencies to be installed.
Consult the README within the argos direcotry or the argos website for details on these.

Once the dependencies are installed, you need to add a build directory within argos and run the `build.sh` script within the argos directory to generate the `iant_main` executable within the `argos/build/sources` directory:

```
cd argos
mkdir build
./build.sh
```

The output of this script should look like the following:

```
./build.sh

-- Using GSL from /usr

```

==== Build Runner

Next you need to build the runner.
cd inso the runner directory and build the java project with maven:
```
cd runner
mvn clean install
```

The output of this command should look like the following:

```
mvn clean install

This generates the `iAntRunner-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` artifact within the `runner/target` directory.

==== Execution

The `iAntRunner-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` includes an experiment runner and associated data analysis tools.  The runner is executed by running the `edu.unm.Runner` class.  `Runner` has the following parameters:
```
java -cp runner/target/iAntRunner-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar edu.unm.Runner -h
usage: edu.unm.Runner
 -a,--argosDirectory <arg>   Root directory of argos.
 -c,--entityCount <arg>      Number of experimental swarm entities.
 -d,--distribution <arg>     Seed distribution to use in the experiment, 0
                             = Random, 1 = Clustered, 2 = Semi-clustered.
 -e,--epochs <arg>           Number of epochs to run the experiment.
 -h,--help                   Prints this message.
 -m,--multiDistriution       Run the experiment against all three
                             distributions.
 -p,--populationSize <arg>   Size of the experiment controller collection
                             to evolve.
 -r,--runtime <arg>          Total runtime of each run of ARGOS in
                             seconds.
 -t,--template <arg>         iAnt.xml template file to use.

```

The following command executes the evolution runner:

```
java -cp runner/target/iAntRunner-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar edu.unm.Runner -t runner/iAnt.xml
```

This will output to standard out the following:

```
java -cp runner/target/iAntRunner-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar edu.unm.Runner -t runner/iAnt.xmlExperimentParameters{populationSize=100, runtime=1800, entityCount=6, startTime=1504025619685}
